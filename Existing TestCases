In the problem "153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array"
It is written that: "[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times"
It should be corrected to 3 times |
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]                   |
[1,2,4,5,6,7,0] #1st rotaion      |
[2,4,5,6,7,0,1] #2nd rotation     |   
[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] #3rd rotation-----
[5,6,7,0,1,2,4]
[6,7,0,1,2,4,5]
[7,0,1,2,4,5,6]
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]
